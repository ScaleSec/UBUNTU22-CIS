# Ubuntu 22.04 LTS CIS Benchmark Ansible Role

This is an Ansible for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS whose primary function is to apply
remediations that conform to the `Level 1 - Server` profile.

The role is based on [ansible-lockdown's](https://github.com/ansible-lockdown/UBUNTU22-CIS).
At the time of writing ([2023/02/23](https://github.com/ansible-lockdown/UBUNTU22-CIS/tree/3b62b12aa2da0ed353a90be80c069bc544a4004e)),
the role is a light update from their 20.04 LTS role to achieve a working MVP
for 22.04 LTS server targets.  This role is heavily modified to align directly
to the 22.04 v1.0 benchmark and provides 90%+ profile coverage for
`Level 1 - Server`.

## Caution(s)

This role assumes a clean install of the Operating System before application. If you are implimenting to an existing system please review this role for any site specific changes that are needed.
